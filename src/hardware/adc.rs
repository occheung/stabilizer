///! Stabilizer ADC management interface
///!
///! # Design
///!
///! Stabilizer ADCs are connected to the MCU via a simplex, SPI-compatible interface. The ADCs
///! require a setup conversion time after asserting the CSn (convert) signal to generate the ADC
///! code from the sampled level. Once the setup time has elapsed, the ADC data is clocked out of
///! MISO. The internal setup time is managed by the SPI peripheral via a CSn setup time parameter
///! during SPI configuration, which allows offloading the management of the setup time to hardware.
///!
///! Because of the SPI-compatibility of the ADCs, a single SPI peripheral + DMA is used to automate
///! the collection of multiple ADC samples without requiring processing by the CPU, which reduces
///! overhead and provides the CPU with more time for processing-intensive tasks, like DSP.
///!
///! The automation of sample collection utilizes three DMA streams, the SPI peripheral, and two
///! timer compare channel for each ADC. One timer comparison channel is configured to generate a
///! comparison event every time the timer is equal to a specific value. Each comparison then
///! generates a DMA transfer event to write into the SPI CR1 register to initiate the transfer.
///! This allows the SPI interface to periodically read a single sample. The other timer comparison
///! channel is configured to generate a comparison event slightly before the first (~10 timer
///! cycles). This channel triggers a separate DMA stream to clear the EOT flag within the SPI
///! peripheral. The EOT flag must be cleared after each transfer or the SPI peripheral will not
///! properly complete the single conversion. Thus, by using two DMA streams and timer comparison
///! channels, the SPI can regularly acquire ADC samples.
///!
///! In order to collect the acquired ADC samples into a RAM buffer, a final DMA transfer is
///! configured to read from the SPI RX FIFO into RAM. The request for this transfer is connected to
///! the SPI RX data signal, so the SPI peripheral will request to move data into RAM whenever it is
///! available. When enough samples have been collected, a transfer-complete interrupt is generated
///! and the ADC samples are available for processing.
///!
///! After a complete transfer of a batch of samples, the inactive buffer is available to the
///! user for processing. The processing must complete before the DMA transfer of the next batch
///! completes.
///!
///! ## Starting Data Collection
///!
///! Because the DMA data collection is automated via timer count comparisons and DMA transfers, the
///! ADCs can be initialized and configured, but will not begin sampling the external ADCs until the
///! sampling timer is enabled. As such, the sampling timer should be enabled after all
///! initialization has completed and immediately before the embedded processing loop begins.
///!
///!
///! ## Batch Sizing
///!
///! The ADCs collect a group of N samples, which is referred to as a batch. The size of the batch
///! is configured by the user at compile-time to allow for a custom-tailored implementation. Larger
///! batch sizes generally provide for lower overhead and more processing time per sample, but come
///! at the expense of increased input -> output latency.
///!
///!
///! # Note
///!
///! While there are two ADCs, only a single ADC is configured to generate transfer-complete
///! interrupts. This is done because it is assumed that the ADCs will always be sampled
///! simultaneously. If only a single ADC is used, it must always be ADC0, as ADC1 will not generate
///! transfer-complete interrupts.
///!
///! There is a very small amount of latency between sampling of ADCs due to bus matrix priority. As
///! such, one of the ADCs will be sampled marginally earlier before the other because the DMA
///! requests are generated simultaneously. This can be avoided by providing a known offset to the
///! sample DMA requests, which can be completed by setting e.g. ADC0's comparison to a counter
///! value of 0 and ADC1's comparison to a counter value of 1.
///!
///! In this implementation, double buffer mode DMA transfers are used because the SPI RX FIFOs
///! have finite depth, FIFO access is slower than AXISRAM access, and because the single
///! buffer mode DMA disable/enable and buffer update sequence is slow.
