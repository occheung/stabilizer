///! Digital Input 0 (DI0) reference clock timestamper
///!
///! This module provides a means of timestamping the rising edges of an external reference clock on
///! the DI0 with a timer value from TIM5.
///!
///! # Design
///! An input capture channel is configured on DI0 and fed into TIM5's capture channel 4. TIM5 is
///! then run in a free-running mode with a configured tick rate (PSC) and maximum count value
///! (ARR). Whenever an edge on DI0 triggers, the current TIM5 counter value is captured and
///! recorded as a timestamp. This timestamp can be either directly read from the timer channel or
///! can be collected asynchronously via DMA collection.
///!
///! To prevent silently discarding timestamps, the TIM5 input capture over-capture flag is
///! continually checked. Any over-capture event (which indicates an overwritten timestamp) then
///! triggers a panic to indicate the dropped timestamp so that design parameters can be adjusted.
///!
///! # Tradeoffs
///! It appears that DMA transfers can take a significant amount of time to disable (400ns) if they
///! are being prematurely stopped (such is the case here). As such, for a sample batch size of 1,
///! this can take up a significant amount of the total available processing time for the samples.
///! This module checks for any captured timestamps from the timer capture channel manually. In
///! this mode, the maximum input clock frequency supported is dependant on the sampling rate and
///! batch size.
///!
///! This module only supports DI0 for timestamping due to trigger constraints on the DIx pins. If
///! timestamping is desired in DI1, a separate timer + capture channel will be necessary.
