///! ADC sample timestamper using external Pounder reference clock.
///!
///! # Design
///!
///! The pounder timestamper utilizes the pounder SYNC_CLK output as a fast external reference clock
///! for recording a timestamp for each of the ADC samples.
///!
///! To accomplish this, a timer peripheral is configured to be driven by an external clock input.
///! Due to the limitations of clock frequencies allowed by the timer peripheral, the SYNC_CLK input
///! is divided by 4. This clock then clocks the timer peripheral in a free-running mode with an ARR
///! (max count register value) configured to overflow once per ADC sample batch.
///!
///! Once the timer is configured, an input capture is configured to record the timer count
///! register. The input capture is configured to utilize an internal trigger for the input capture.
///! The internal trigger is selected such that when a sample is generated on ADC0, the input
///! capture is simultaneously triggered. That trigger is prescaled (its rate is divided) by the
///! batch size. This results in the input capture triggering identically to when the ADC samples
///! the last sample of the batch. That sample is then available for processing by the user.
